# Stochastic Processes Lecture Notes

This repository contains LaTeX notes for the "Stochastic Processes" lecture by Professor Wojciech Matysiak at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science (MiNi) at Warsaw University of Technology.

## Generation Process

The `.tex` script was created through a multi-step process primarily utilizing Google's Gemini models for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and content refinement.

1.  **Initial OCR:** Small sections of handwritten lecture notes were processed via OCR.
2.  **Revision:** A secondary prompt was used to revise and verify the accuracy of the initial OCR output.
3.  **Lecture Assembly:** The revised sections for each lecture were merged together.
4.  **Script Integration:** Individual lectures were then integrated into the main script, with a prompt designed to ensure contextual and logical flow between topics.
5.  **Manual Refinement:** Some manual editing and additions were made to finalize the notes.

## Model Performance

Different AI models were evaluated for the OCR task. Gemini models demonstrated superior performance, accurately capturing over 90% of the content from the source images. In contrast, models from OpenAI and Anthropic tested during the process failed to capture even 50% of the content correctly.

The earlier lectures were processed using Gemini 2.5, while the final lectures were completed with a Gemini 3-era model.
